# Print-PDFNewPrinter
Adds printer and port, prints PDF file and removes printer and port

Sometimes I search for printers in my company and cannot find them, because someone moved them without notice. So I print a page with instructions to contact me. That's what this script is for.

1. Asks for printer hostname (or ip)
2. automatically runs
   1. create printer port
   2. create printer
   3. print file 
   4. delete printer
   5. delete printer port
